# TDD-Katas
> A repository to store and provide solutions for different TDD Katas.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to give a concise and thorough introduction of TDD (Test Driven Development) with the help of the so called Katas. Since TDD has become an unseparable part of development I decided to start this project to help myself and others who struggle with how TDD is supposed to be implemented in an Agile environment by creating Katas which if done properly will advance your skills and understanding of this so needed technique.
