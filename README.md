# TDD-Katas
> A repository to store and provide solutions for different TDD Katas.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to give a concise and thorough introduction of TDD (Test Driven Development) with the help of the so called Katas. Since TDD has become an unseparable part of development I decided to start this project to help myself and others who struggle with how TDD is supposed to be implemented in an Agile environment by creating Katas which if done properly will advance your skills and understanding of this so needed technique.

# Structure and how to approach the Katas

## Structure
Each Kata will have two main content components:
  * Problem description
  * Solution
  
 Now I encourage everyone to start from the problem description and work his way up before looking at the solution I would provide (there are no wrong solutions, but the point here is to solve the problem all by yourselves). Once you are feeling comfortable with the Kata you started and mark it as done, move to the next one. As the saying goes: Practise makes perfect :).

## Approach
The approach as discussed will be TDD oriented, but what does that mean actually? Now the essence of the TDD is create your tests first and work your way in designing the solution, based on those tests you created. Every time you implement a case, run the tests and see where the solution fails and passes. Repeat until all possible cases are covered. But how to properly identify what we should test and not? One thing worth remembering is that not everything needs to be tested!!!

### How to identify test cases
Probably good tests would be rules or requirements mentioned in the problem description. ONe example could be the popular FizzBuzz problem. What the problem requires is to find the numbers which divide 3 and 5 evenly and print Fizz and Buzz respectively and for the ones which divide both - FizzBuzz. Now here clearly there are three requirements which need to be implemented. And if you read the statement again, they all make good tests. So, for each one we create a test that should pass and one that should fail. In the beginning, of course, everything will fail, but start designing your solution using the approach mentioned above and see how easy solving the problems becomes.

This approach can be used in solving any problem, no matter how easy or difficult it is.

# Conclusion
May the odds be ever in your favour and most importantly have fun :D.
